### Introduction
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;This is a project concerning Synthetic-to-Real Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation for Scene Text Detection in the Wild

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;we propose a synthetic-to-real domain adaptation method for scene text detection, which transfers knowledge from synthetic data (source domain) to real data (target domain)
